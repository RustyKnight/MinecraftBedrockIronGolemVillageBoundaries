![MinecraftBedrock](https://img.shields.io/badge/MinecraftBedrock-1.19.30-orange)

## Description

Villages are a bit of a mess for precision. This pack is not going to give you precise locations of the golum spawn area or village bounds, it will give you one of the possible precise volumes they can spawn in. The center of the village is an "unordered list" where each time a villager is added or removed from the village, or each time the server is updated the order of the list may change. If the order of the list changes the bed that is the village center may or may not change. So for the purposes of this pack we must use each bed as a reference (or at least he most extreme beds). The volume outlined by the pack will show you possible areas that he iron golem could spawn, and the possible bounds for the village.

The village bounds are where raids will start from. this is really handy for drawing "raid borders" or defensive borders. it is also really handy for raid farms and other things like that. If protecting a village from raids, build your walls around the smallest volume that overlaps, if you are making a "don't cross this line" choose the largest volume that overlaps.

## Taken from

[Bedrock Technical Resource Pack](https://github.com/RavinMaddHatter/Bedrock-Technical-Resource-Pack)

This strips out the feature into a standalone addon and updates it to support 1.19.30

## How To Use

To use this feature, place an armor stand on the outlying "most extreme" pillows in the village (of if your village is not organized, then all pillows). 

Equip the armor stand with a **iron ingot** or **red flower**. The pink cube represents a potential area the the golem can spawn in. The yellow cube represents the village boundary if the armor stand were standing on the designated village center.

* This is subject to random shuffling to any bed in the village.
